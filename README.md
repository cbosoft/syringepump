# Intro

This software controls a syringe pump (device used to push fluid through a
channel at a closely controlled flow rate and stress). The device was originally
intended for medicine delivery, however it is now used for rheological testing.

# Installation

Download a zip file of a release from the [releases page](https://github.com/cbosoft/syringepump/releases)

Then installation is as simple as unzipping in your preferred location! Doesn't
have to be anywhere special. All the zip contains is the program itself, an XML
file which contains the user interface, and this readme file.
